# Project Name : Lending case study

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
• If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
• If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

### Problem statement
The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- What is the background of your project? -->  code is in Python
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?  --> identifying the pattern if a person is likely to default the loan
- What is the dataset that is being used?  --> lending data set is used

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- People with living in rented home or mortgazed their home have fully paid the loan and they are less likely to default
- People with shorter interest replay term are more likely to get charged off
- People whose annual income is not verified are more likely to charged off
- Income range 0-20000 has high chances of charged off. The chances reduces for the people with higher income bracket
